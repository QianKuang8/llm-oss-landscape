## How Do We Select Projects?

We utilize [OpenRank](https://open-digger.cn/en/docs/user_docs/metrics/openrank) to assess community engagement and project vitality. Our current selection criteria requires projects to achieve an OpenRank score of at least 50 for the most recent month.

To explore OpenRank trends for any GitHub repository, install the [HyperCRX](https://github.com/hypertrons/hypertrons-crx) browser extension.

## Why Does Ant Open Source Create This?

As Ant Group's Open Source Team, our mission is to decode the evolution of the large language model development ecosystem through comprehensive community data analysis. We seek to identify emerging trends and understand which leading projects are driving innovation in this rapidly evolving space.

Our panoramic analysis and trend research aims to harness insights from the open-source community to inform and guide the strategic evolution of Ant's technological architecture and development practices.

We are dedicated to maintaining this initiative continuously, releasing fresh insights regularly, and fostering collaborative growth with the broader community through open participation.
